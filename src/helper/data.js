      "Aside from 1985, you could argue that 2013 was the best year for Jordan 1 fans thanks to releases like the Air Jordan Retro 1 High OG Bred colorway. While there tends to be Air Jordan 1 colorways released every year, in 2013 Jordan Brand went back to the original formula for Jordan 1s. They introduced the OG versions of the Jordan 1, which featured Nike Air labeling on the tongue and on the insoles as well. Jordan collectors often place a higher value on these tiny details because when the original Nike Air Jordan released in 1985, the Jumpman logo hadn’t even been created, which means the retro AJ1s with the Jumpman on the tongue, heel or insole, are just not quite the same. Surprisingly, the Bred Jordan 1 OG didn’t release until the end of 2013, which meant two things. There were a lot of other Jordan Retro 1 High OG colorways that had already come out and the holiday release meant there would also be a Jordan 11 releasing near the same time. That didn’t seem to make an ounce of difference with sneaker enthusiasts and Jordan fans. The 2013 Air Jordan Retro High OG Bred sold out in what seemed like seconds and even the restocks that followed were scooped up quickly, making this Black/Varsity Red colorway more than worth its weight in leather.",
